I am Rui Wu, a researcher focusing on the fundamental understanding of the impact of climate change (e.g., water availability, temperature riser/drop) on rock mechanics and physics from lab to site scale. Currently, I am a research scientist at the State Key Laboratory (SKL) of Intelligent Coal Mining and Strata Control, Beijing, China. Before joining SKL, I graduated from ETH Zurich with a Ph.D. thesis titled 'Laboratory acousto-mechanical studies into moisture-induced changes of elastic properties in fine-grained granite' in 2022.
