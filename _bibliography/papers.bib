abstract = {Water infiltration into fractures is ubiquitous in crustal rocks. However, little is known about how such a progressive wetting process affects fracture stiffness and seismic wave propagation, which are highly relevant for characterizing fracture systems in situ. We study the acousto-mechanical behavior of a free-standing fractured granite subjected to gradual water infiltration with a downward-moving wetting front over 12 days. We observe significant differences (i.e., by an order of magnitude) in wave amplitudes across the fractured granite compared to an intact granite, with both cases showing a strong correlation between wave amplitudes and wetting front movement. Effects of water infiltration into the fracture and surrounding matrix on seismic attenuation are captured by a numerical model with parameters constrained by experimental data. Back-calculated fracture stiffness decreases exponentially with the wetting front migration along the fracture. We propose that moisture-induced matrix expansion around the fracture increases asperity mismatch, leading to reduced fracture stiffness.},

abstract = {Calibrated acoustic emission (AE) systems become recently popularized and help to relate the produced AE signals to their source in terms of the physics that created them. The methodology surrounding this has potential benefits that will bridge the gap between the fields of damage/fracture mechanics and seismology in the laboratory (e.g., 1kHz$\sim$1MHz) and field scale (e.g., 1Hz$\sim$1kHz). However, to calibrate AE systems, the empirical Green's functions (EGF) between AE sensors and external/internal sources are essentially required. There is currently a lack of detailed and robust modeling descriptions on how to get the corresponding EGFs. This paper aims to illustrate the utility of the finite element method (FEM) to acquire broadband EGF response (1kHz to 1MHz), which adequately covers the frequency range of laboratory AEs. We validated this FEM-based methodology by studying the transient propagation of the elastic waves in solid materials. By combining results from coarse and fine meshes, the broadband EGF is derived with small computational costs. This study provides a promising framework to analyze the AE sensor responses and further gathers critical information of earthquake source physics, for example, the radiated seismic energy during the fracturing process.},

abstract = {Experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to infer changes in a fracture's stiffness using properties of the transmitted elastic waves for dry and saturated conditions. However, little attention has been paid to how progressive wetting of the fracture affects the transmitted energy and moisture-dependent fracture stiffness. Here, we study the time-lapse acousto-mechanical responses on a free-standing fractured specimen of Herrnholz granite over 270 hours while moisture is introduced, causing a progressive wetting front. The transmitted amplitude of direct P waves is measured across the single natural fracture using ultrasonic pulse transmission; in parallel, the real-time moisture profile is tracked in the host rock using digital imaging correlation (DIC). We observe significant differences in the amplitude changes between a fractured and an intact companion specimen, which allows inferring the fracture contributions. The adsorption-induced deformation of the fractured sample decreases the transmitted amplitude by an order of magnitude more than in the intact case. Elastic wave propagation is modeled using Finite Elements to investigate the effects of wetting of fracture and reconcile the observations using ultrasonic measurements. Moisture-dependent fracture stiffness is estimated using an inverse modeling technique and decreases following a power law as the wetting front migrates from the fracture's mouth to its tip.The data sets used in the analysis are contained in this data set and can be accessed in Matlab 2019.

abstract = {The water adsorption into pore spaces in brittle rocks affects wave velocity and transmitted amplitude of elastic waves. Experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to characterize moisture-induced elastodynamic variations due to macroporous effects; however, little attention has been paid to the manner in which wetting of nanopores affects elastic wave transmission. In this work, we extend our understanding of moisture-induced elastic changes in a microcracked nanopore-dominated medium where 80 % of the surface area exhibits pore diameters (also include microcrack widths) below 10 nm. We study acousto-mechanical response resulting from a gradual wetting on a free-standing intact Herrnholz granite specimen over 98 h using time-lapse ultrasonic and digital imaging techniques. Linkages between ultrasonic attributes and adsorption-induced stress/strain are established during the approach of the wetting front. We find that Gassmann theory, previously validated in channel-like nanoporous media, does not work properly in predicting the P-wave velocity increase of microcracked nanopore-dominated media at ultrasonic frequency. However, squirt flow – a theory recognized to characterize wave velocity increase and attenuation in microcracked macropore-dominated media at the pore scale – also accounts for the observed increase of P-wave velocity in microcracked nanopore-dominated media. The transmitted amplitude changes in direct P waves are explained and predicted by the elastic wave propagation within P-wave first Fresnel zone and reflection/refraction on the wetting front.},

abstract = {Time-dependent rock deformation is considered to precede dynamic failure in many rock-engineering projects and natural geohazards. In order to understand long-term performance of brittle rocks, we gather mechanical load, strain, acoustic emission (AE) and digital image correlation (DIC) data to describe the evolution of damage and cracking in response to tensile loading during multi-stage relaxation experiments on inverted single edge notch bending (iSENB) specimens. The source locations of the AEs correspond to a process zone ahead and around the notch indicating the evolution of the microcracks. The results showed that the cracks first start aseismicaly under subcritical growth until 10mm from the tip of the notch and then they grow seismically by showing seismic signals in the form of acoustic emissions. It was observed that the process zone obtained by DIC is smaller than the cloud of the AE locations. This can be partially because DIC only shows surface deformation and partially because of the errors associated with the AE source locations such as ignoring anisotropic velocity, sampling rate, sensor locations, etc. Moment tensor analyses of the AE signals showed that both tensile and shear cracks are involved in the micro-scale although in the macroscopic scale the damage process is mostly considered as tensile. The results showed that microcracks start as tensile, and then continue as shear, especially at the end of the crack where the specimen experiences compression loading.},

abstract = {The application of absolutely calibrated piezoelectric (PZT) sensors is increasingly used to help interpret the information carried by radiated elastic waves of laboratory/in situs acoustic emissions (AEs) in nondestructive evaluation. In this paper, we present the methodology based on the finite element method (FEM) to characterize PZT sensors. The FEM-based modelling tool is used to numerically compute the true Green's function between a ball impact source and an array of PZT sensors to map active source to theoretical ground motion. Physical-based boundary conditions are adopted to better constrain the problem of body wave propagation, reflection and transmission in/on the elastic medium. The modelling methodology is first validated against the reference approach (generalized ray theory) and is then extended down to 1 kHz where body wave reflection and transmission along different types of boundaries are explored. We find the Green's functions calculated using physical-based boundaries have distinct differences between commonly employed idealized boundary conditions, especially around the anti-resonant and resonant frequencies. Unlike traditional methods that use singular ball drops, we find that each ball drop is only partially reliable over specific frequency bands. We demonstrate, by adding spectral constraints, that the individual instrumental responses are accurately cropped and linked together over 1 kHz to 1 MHz after which they overlap with little amplitude shift. This study finds that ball impacts with a broad range of diameters as well as the corresponding valid frequency bandwidth, are necessary to characterize broadband PZT sensors from 1 kHz to 1 MHz.},

abstract = {We investigated the force produced by a conical piezoelectric (PZT, lead zirconate titanate) transducer actuated by high voltage pulses (HVP) in contact with a steel transfer plate. Using elastic wave propagation theory in a semi-infinite plate, we aimed to quantify the magnitude and estimate the shape of the force–time function via the body waves produced in the transfer plate using the displacement field recorded on an array of 20 absolutely calibrated PZT receivers. We first calibrated the receiver array using glass capillary fracture. We proceeded to use a conical PZT transducer to actively produce a source at the origin, allowing us to study the displacement field produced on the now calibrated PZT receiver array. We studied two types of HVP: An impulsive and step source. The calibrated receiver array was used to estimate the general shape of the force–time functions for each type of HVP. From our hypothesized force–time functions we were able to estimate the peak force produced by the PZT actuator: The impulsive source generated a force of fpeak= 2.90 ± 0.42 N and the step source generated fpeak= 1.79 ± 0.30 N, respectively, for a peak applied voltage of 273 V. This translates to an applied force of ∼ 0.011 N/V and 0.007 N/V for the impulse and step force–time functions, respectively, which is similar to estimates found in the literature for other conical transducers in contact with metallic transfer media. This measurement was verified directly by independent measurements of the peak force fpeak using a dynamic force transducer. We found that our methodology correctly estimated the magnitude of the force but is limited to transducers with incident angles $\theta$< 53∘. Beyond this angle, overestimates of the force were observed due to the lack of body wave energy produced by the source. These results allow us to quantitatively determine the forces produced by active PZT techniques using only the measurement of the displacement field captured on a calibrated conical PZT array. Quantitative understanding of active PZT sources additionally constrains the transfer functions approach, which is commonly used in the non-destructive testing of materials and in other fields, such as rock physics and laboratory seismology.},
