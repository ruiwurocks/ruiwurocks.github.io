abstract = {Water infiltration into fractures is ubiquitous in crustal rocks. However, little is known about how such a progressive wetting process affects fracture stiffness and seismic wave propagation, which are highly relevant for characterizing fracture systems in situ. We study the acousto-mechanical behavior of a free-standing fractured granite subjected to gradual water infiltration with a downward-moving wetting front over 12 days. We observe significant differences (i.e., by an order of magnitude) in wave amplitudes across the fractured granite compared to an intact granite, with both cases showing a strong correlation between wave amplitudes and wetting front movement. Effects of water infiltration into the fracture and surrounding matrix on seismic attenuation are captured by a numerical model with parameters constrained by experimental data. Back-calculated fracture stiffness decreases exponentially with the wetting front migration along the fracture. We propose that moisture-induced matrix expansion around the fracture increases asperity mismatch, leading to reduced fracture stiffness.},

abstract = {It is crucial to understand the scaling behaviors of acoustic emissions (AEs) preceding damage localization in order to predict failures of brittle solids under compression. Yet, the effect of length scale on the complex interplay between the initiation, propagation, and coalescence of pre-existing fracture networks and corresponding AE behaviors is poorly understood. In this study, we perform laboratory compressional experiments on naturally fractured rocks at four sample sizes from 50 to 300 mm whose strength generally exhibits a finite-size effect. We analyze the time history of AE energy distribution and accelerated seismic release (ASR) until catastrophic failures of the specimens. We find their time evolution towards failure resembles the observations from specimens containing a single fault and highly microstructurally disordered materials. We observe clear evidence that a size effect exists at small AE magnitude, where larger specimens tend to produce a higher proportion of smaller microcracks. However, the AE energy distribution is scale-independent at high energies. Near to failure, the power-law component of the AE energy population is almost stationary. The temporal evolution of the AE activity rate is independent of sample size; instead, there exist fast and slow periods of the AE activity rate that could be attributed to the stress heterogeneities around the fracture network. ASRs are exclusively observed in the AE activity rate and are more general in the lack of criticality. Our interpretation of observed foreshock activities at varying sample sizes in fractured media may have significance for understanding and predicting failures from natural hazards and engineering instabilities.},

abstract = {The water adsorption into pore spaces in brittle rocks affects wave velocity and transmitted amplitude of elastic waves. Experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to characterize moisture-induced elastodynamic variations due to macroporous effects; however, little attention has been paid to the manner in which wetting of nanopores affects elastic wave transmission. In this work, we extend our understanding of moisture-induced elastic changes in a microcracked nanopore-dominated medium where 80 % of the surface area exhibits pore diameters (also include microcrack widths) below 10 nm. We study acousto-mechanical response resulting from a gradual wetting on a free-standing intact Herrnholz granite specimen over 98 h using time-lapse ultrasonic and digital imaging techniques. Linkages between ultrasonic attributes and adsorption-induced stress/strain are established during the approach of the wetting front. We find that Gassmann theory, previously validated in channel-like nanoporous media, does not work properly in predicting the P-wave velocity increase of microcracked nanopore-dominated media at ultrasonic frequency. However, squirt flow – a theory recognized to characterize wave velocity increase and attenuation in microcracked macropore-dominated media at the pore scale – also accounts for the observed increase of P-wave velocity in microcracked nanopore-dominated media. The transmitted amplitude changes in direct P waves are explained and predicted by the elastic wave propagation within P-wave first Fresnel zone and reflection/refraction on the wetting front.},

@article{Wu2021,
abstract = {The application of absolutely calibrated piezoelectric (PZT) sensors is increasingly used to help interpret the information carried by radiated elastic waves of laboratory/in situs acoustic emissions (AEs) in nondestructive evaluation. In this paper, we present the methodology based on the finite element method (FEM) to characterize PZT sensors. The FEM-based modelling tool is used to numerically compute the true Green's function between a ball impact source and an array of PZT sensors to map active source to theoretical ground motion. Physical-based boundary conditions are adopted to better constrain the problem of body wave propagation, reflection and transmission in/on the elastic medium. The modelling methodology is first validated against the reference approach (generalized ray theory) and is then extended down to 1 kHz where body wave reflection and transmission along different types of boundaries are explored. We find the Green's functions calculated using physical-based boundaries have distinct differences between commonly employed idealized boundary conditions, especially around the anti-resonant and resonant frequencies. Unlike traditional methods that use singular ball drops, we find that each ball drop is only partially reliable over specific frequency bands. We demonstrate, by adding spectral constraints, that the individual instrumental responses are accurately cropped and linked together over 1 kHz to 1 MHz after which they overlap with little amplitude shift. This study finds that ball impacts with a broad range of diameters as well as the corresponding valid frequency bandwidth, are necessary to characterize broadband PZT sensors from 1 kHz to 1 MHz.},

abstract = {We investigated the force produced by a conical piezoelectric (PZT, lead zirconate titanate) transducer actuated by high voltage pulses (HVP) in contact with a steel transfer plate. Using elastic wave propagation theory in a semi-infinite plate, we aimed to quantify the magnitude and estimate the shape of the force–time function via the body waves produced in the transfer plate using the displacement field recorded on an array of 20 absolutely calibrated PZT receivers. We first calibrated the receiver array using glass capillary fracture. We proceeded to use a conical PZT transducer to actively produce a source at the origin, allowing us to study the displacement field produced on the now calibrated PZT receiver array. We studied two types of HVP: An impulsive and step source. The calibrated receiver array was used to estimate the general shape of the force–time functions for each type of HVP. From our hypothesized force–time functions we were able to estimate the peak force produced by the PZT actuator: The impulsive source generated a force of fpeak= 2.90 ± 0.42 N and the step source generated fpeak= 1.79 ± 0.30 N, respectively, for a peak applied voltage of 273 V. This translates to an applied force of ∼ 0.011 N/V and 0.007 N/V for the impulse and step force–time functions, respectively, which is similar to estimates found in the literature for other conical transducers in contact with metallic transfer media. This measurement was verified directly by independent measurements of the peak force fpeak using a dynamic force transducer. We found that our methodology correctly estimated the magnitude of the force but is limited to transducers with incident angles $\theta$< 53∘. Beyond this angle, overestimates of the force were observed due to the lack of body wave energy produced by the source. These results allow us to quantitatively determine the forces produced by active PZT techniques using only the measurement of the displacement field captured on a calibrated conical PZT array. Quantitative understanding of active PZT sources additionally constrains the transfer functions approach, which is commonly used in the non-destructive testing of materials and in other fields, such as rock physics and laboratory seismology.},
